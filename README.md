# To-Do list

I'm using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for making it. Some basic syntax I've learn and use it for this. 

Your list that has edited in this website couldn't save to database because I didn't use the data store method. I recently learn ReactJS for storing datas so you can keep the list. But it might take a long time, so be patient...
